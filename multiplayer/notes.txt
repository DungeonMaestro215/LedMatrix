Mix colors

Paint:
    Performance issues with many cells in grid

    X Variable size
    X bucket
    X make work on mobile
    X fix wrapping
    X adding buttons for tool
    more tools?
        X colorpicker?
    clean and comment code

    After picking color, reselect the brush tool (?)
    X Fix bug with line from last mouse up


MultiPaint:
    Websockets
        Better track ID of user
    Make painting fade
    add cursors
        Move some cursor code to View
        Player's cursor should not have to update through WS (makes it laggy)
    Updating Grid
        Don't update with same changes from this client 
        Wait to send changes... somehow (on 'stop' or after a certain number of changes?)
    

Cursors
    Doesn't work on mobile...
